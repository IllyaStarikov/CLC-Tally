# CLC Tally
Part of the responsibilities of a worker at the Computer Learning Center (CLC) at Missouri S&T is monitor the number of students using the computers. CLC Tally is my semi-automated way of doing so.

The counter is quite simple: 

- Swipe up or tap the screen to increment the counter.
- Swipe down to decrement the counter.
- Press and hold to reset the screen.

And that's it. At the end of this shift, press the list icon to get a comprehensive list of everyone (broken down by the hour) that has entered the lab.

The Safari icon takes you directly to the Github page, and the about simply summarizes the UI of CLC Tally.
